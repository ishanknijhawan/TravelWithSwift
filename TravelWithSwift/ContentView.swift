During the 18th and early 19th centuries the population of the Highlands rose to around 300,000, but from c. 1841 and for the next 160 years, the natural increase in population was exceeded by emigration (mostly to Canada, the United States, Australia and New Zealand, and migration to the industrial cities of Scotland and England.) The area is now one of the most sparsely populated in Europe. At 9.1/km2 (24/sq mi) in 2012, the population density in the Highlands and Islands is less than one seventh of Scotland's as a whole, comparable with that of Bolivia, Chad and Russia.")

If you accidentally said 'you too' after a cinema usher ripped your ticket and told you to enjoy the film and now need to fly to the opposite end of the planet and assume a false name to avoid eternal embarrassment, we're here to help. TL;DR: we're pretty darn good at vacations.")
